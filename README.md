# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs via Predictive Modeling of Congestion Zones

## Overview

This project aims to reduce last-mile delivery expenses by 15% within six months.  It achieves this by developing a predictive model that identifies and mitigates congestion-prone delivery zones. The analysis leverages historical delivery data to pinpoint areas consistently experiencing delays and high fuel consumption.  The model then predicts future congestion, allowing for proactive route optimization and resource allocation to minimize costs.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings and analysis to the console, including details on identified congestion zones, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall), and cost savings projections.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., heatmaps showing congestion density, charts illustrating cost reduction projections)  in the `output` directory.  These visualizations provide a clear visual representation of the model's predictions and their impact on cost optimization.  The exact filenames will depend on the data used and the specific analyses performed.
